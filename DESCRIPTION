Description: Posterior sampling in several commonly used distributions using
    normalized power prior as described in 
    Duan, Ye and Smith (2006) <doi:10.1002/env.752> and 
    Ibrahim et.al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/sim.6728>. 
    Sampling of the power parameter is achieved via 
    either independence Metropolis-Hastings or random walk Metropolis-Hastings 
    based on transformation.
